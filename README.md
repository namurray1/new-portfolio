# new-portfolio
This project will be a new and updated portfolio. The portfolio will give a little background information on me, my interest, and of course web development projects I am currently working on as well as past projects. This project will incorporate standard HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I will also include Bootstrap and jQuery for styling and dynamics.
